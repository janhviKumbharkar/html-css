				<h1 id="sub_title">Vivekananda: A True Hero</h1>

				<p>Swami Vivekananda (1863–1902) is best known in the United States for his groundbreaking speech to the
					1893 World’s Parliament of Religions in which he introduced Hinduism to America and called for
					religious
					tolerance and an end to fanaticism. Born Narendranath Dutta, he was the chief disciple of the
					19th-century mystic Ramakrishna and the founder of Ramakrishna Mission. Swami Vivekananda is also
					considered a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the West and is credited with
					raising
					the profile of Hinduism to that of a world religion.</p>
